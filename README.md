# ML-Classification-Model-Development

A set of Jupyter Notebooks solutions for the classification final case study in my class of Machine Learning - DAT-5303.

Each of the case studies had strict requirements based on high model performance, bias/ variance tradeoff, model run-time, and selected libraries.

About the case
Apprentice Chef, Inc. is an innovative company with a unique spin on cooking at home. Developed for the busy professional that has little to no skills in the kitchen, they offer a wide selection of daily-prepared gourmet meals delivered directly to your door. Each meal set takes at most 30 minutes to finish cooking at home and also comes with Apprentice Chef's award-winning disposable cookware (i.e. pots, pans, baking trays, and utensils), allowing for fast and easy cleanup. Ordering meals is very easy given their user-friendly online platform and mobile app.


Classification Case:

In an effort to diversify their revenue stream, Apprentice Chef, Inc. has launched Halfway There, a cross-selling promotion where subscribers receive a half bottle of wine from a local California vineyard every Wednesday (halfway through the work week). The executives at Apprentice Chef also believe this endeavor will create a competitive advantage based on its unique product offering of hard to find local wines from smaller vineyards.

Halfway There has been exclusively offered to all of the customers in the dataset you received, and the executives would like to promote this service to a wider audience. They have tasked you with analyzing their data, developing your top insights, and building a machine learning model to predict which customers will subscribe to this service.
